# Hello World ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a seasoned pentester and hacker with a passion for all things security, particularly in the realm of blockchain. As a Microsoft MVP in security, I strive to stay on top of the latest trends and technologies in the field and to share my knowledge and expertise with others.
My GitHub repositories showcase my work in Blockchain Security (till now):
- Solana Blockchain security: I've worked on a number of projects related to Solana Blockchain Security, including smart contract auditing, vulnerability research, and the development of secure blockchain applications. Check out my blockchain-focused repositories to see some of my latest work in this exciting and rapidly evolving field.

I'm always looking for new opportunities to collaborate with other security professionals and to contribute to the wider security community. If you're interested in working together or have any questions about my work, don't hesitate to get in touch. Together, we can make the world a safer place.
